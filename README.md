# hello-world
Just another repository (testing how github works) (1)

Hello! This change is being made in the readme-edits branch, and I will save the changes - called a commit - but the first save will only occur within the branch. This means right now, the file is different to the one in the master file.
I shall open a pull request, which is a request to merge this branch into the master. The pull request allows people to see 'diffs' or what is different from the content of both branches. (2)
